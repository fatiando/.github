**Reminders**:

- [ ] Run `make format` and `make check` to make sure the code follows the style guide.
- [ ] Add tests for new features or tests that would have caught the bug that you're fixing.
- [ ] Add new public functions/methods/classes to `doc/api/index.rst` and the base `__init__.py` file for the package.
- [ ] Write detailed docstrings for all functions/classes/methods. It often helps to design better code if you write the docstrings first.
- [ ] If adding new functionality, add an example to the docstring, gallery, and/or tutorials.
